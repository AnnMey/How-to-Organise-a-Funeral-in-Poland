The funeral grant is paid to cover funeral expenses.

The maximum amount of the funeral grant is PLN 4,000.00 (around EUR 850,00).

The funeral grant is paid in case of the death of:
*	an  insured person,
*	a retired person,
*	a (disability) pensioner,
*	members of their families,
*	persons who  fulfilled the conditions for a pension.

The funeral grant is also paid when: 
* the insured person dies after the end of insurance,  
* the death occurred when receiving sickness allowance, rehabilitation benefit or maternity allowance.

If the funeral costs were incurred by a family member of the deceased, he/she is entitled to the grant in full amount. It is not important what the actual expenses were.
On the other hand, if the funeral costs were covered by a person from outside of the family (e.g. neighbour, employer) or an entity (e.g. a social welfare facility, municipality, poviat, legal person, church or religious association), the funeral grant is payable in the amount of documented funeral costs, a maximum of PLN 4,000.00. If the costs were incurred by several persons or entities, the funeral grant is divided among them in proportion to their share.
